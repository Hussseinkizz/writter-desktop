## Notes Feb 22 2025 7:33 PM

- stuff looking good, but need to fix type error in defualt page, and add a loading state for the editor and change the setup to use the new tuari + vite recommended setup in thier docs.
- also need to make sure editing works and state syncs across the panes, the editor and the markdown preview
- these features also: Meet my side project: editing time count, word count, ai auto completions, grammar checking, auto save, desktop support with offline support and soon cloud syncing... ðŸ˜Š
