# Writter Desktop - Development Context

## Project Overview
A Tauri-based desktop markdown editor built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components. Focus on simplicity, offline-first approach, and technical writer-friendly features.

## Current Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18.3.1, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4.1.10
- **Desktop**: Tauri 2.x with Rust backend
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **Editor**: CodeMirror 6 with markdown support
- **Preview**: react-markdown with GitHub markdown CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks with Tauri plugin-store for persistence
- **Build**: Vite 6.x, TypeScript 5.6.2

### Current Features
- âœ… Markdown editing with CodeMirror
- âœ… Live preview with react-markdown
- âœ… File tree navigation
- âœ… Auto-save functionality
- âœ… Project folder management
- âœ… Settings persistence (partial)
- âœ… Word count tracking
- âœ… Dark theme

### Known Issues (from build analysis)
- Build works but has large chunks (1.2MB main chunk)
- Preview component always visible by default
- No plugin system
- Limited settings panel
- No markdown utilities
- File drag/drop needs to be replaced with context menu

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style Requirements
- **Functions only** - No classes or OOP patterns
- **Functional composition** - Small functions composed into complex logic
- **Max 400 lines per file** - Split large files into modules
- **JSDoc comments** - For clarity and explanation
- **Modular approach** - Separate logic from UI components via props

### Dependencies to Add
- `framer-motion` - For subtle animations
- `vitest` - For testing
- Additional dependencies as needed per phase

### Testing Strategy
- Use vitest for unit tests
- Test new features without breaking existing functionality
- Focus on critical paths and user interactions

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Fixes âœ… COMPLETED

## Project Status: âœ… COMPLETE

All planned phases have been successfully implemented:
- âœ… Phase 1: Foundation & Core Fixes
- âœ… Phase 2: File Management Improvements  
- âœ… Phase 3: Plugin System
- âœ… Phase 4: Settings & Persistence
- âœ… Phase 5: Markdown Utilities
- âœ… Phase 6: Enhanced Features

The Writter desktop markdown editor now features a comprehensive set of tools for technical writers, including file management, plugin system, markdown utilities, background music, and todo management - all following functional programming principles with no classes used anywhere in the codebase.

## Notes
- All toast notifications use sonner (already installed)
- UI components must use shadcn/ui
- Keep the "notepad-style" simplicity - avoid over-engineering
- Focus on technical writers' workflow
