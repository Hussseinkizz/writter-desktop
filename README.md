## Why Choose Writter?

Well, most editors around are focused on non technical people, they have drag and drop and notion style experience which is all good, but that is a bit limitting to a technical person who just wants to document things up easily and with full control, now this is where writter comes in, create your markdown files and do anything you want with them, a cloud backup solution will be available but just optional. This geared towards local first, simplicity and full control over how you write your stuff.
